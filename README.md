As you can see, there are two screens. The smaller one can leave on the top layer of the computer screen and you can fill the Order Number on it all the time you like. Then, the bigger screen will show up and the search result will be listed on it. On the other hand, the bigger one can on the top screen if you select it but it is not set on the top in other cases. And you can fill the Order Number then see the result sequently.
